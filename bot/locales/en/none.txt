What do you mean?
How to write?
How are you?
I do not know what to write...
I... I, can't write anything...
Sending a message... Error, an error message has been sent.
An error has been detected...
Generation error...
Generation interrupted. ERROR.
I tell you NO.
I tell you YES.
Hey! I'm one of those annoying freaks who thinks you're stunningly beautiful.
They told me you were looking for me...
You have an amazing smile!
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to tell you urgently that you're awfully nice.
I've been thinking about a reason to meet you for an hour now, but so far I haven't come up with anything.
It's good that it's so noisy here, and you still won't hear the nonsense that I'm about to tell you. Ouch...
You know, the Constitution says that you cannot deprive a person of the right to happiness...
You know, I just realized one thing. I could have stayed at home today and never found out about your existence. Terrible prospect, right?
I feel dark energy. Now it's better not to write anything...
Evil forces took away my mind, now I can only write about the fact that I canâ€™t do anything...
Coldly. Possible precipitation in the form of errors on the server. Carefully.
Today I will have a day off from all of you!
I'm waiting for an answer...
The wait is over.
So-ooo, goodbye!
